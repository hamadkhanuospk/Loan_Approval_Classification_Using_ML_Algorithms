# Loan_Approval_Classification_Using_ML_Algorithms

1. Consider the Loangrant.CSV dataset which have been provided  you at the start of the semester.
2. Do all pre-processing steps (missing values, outliers, duplicate instances etc).
3. Use Decision Tree, Bagging, Boosting, Random Forest, KNN, and Support Vector Machines models for classification of  given data. Split the data into 80%:20% ratio for the model training and testing.
4. Find the confusion matrices of each algorithms at 20% Test and 80% training datasets..
5. Find the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, MCC (Mathew correlation coefficient) , ROC curve plots for each algorithms.
